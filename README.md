Blockchain platform Hyperledger Iroha is designed for simple creation and management of assets. This is a distributed ledger of transactions.

Iroha has the following features:
1. Creation and management of custom complex assets, such as currencies or indivisible rights, serial numbers, patents, etc.
2. Management of user accounts
3. Taxonomy of accounts based on _domains_ — or _sub-ledgers_ in the system
4. The system of rights and verification of user permissions for the execution of transactions and queries in the system
5. Validation of business rules for transactions and queries in the system

Among the non-functional requirements can be noted a high degree of network fault tolerance _(Byzantine Fault Tolerant)_.

## Iroha repository 101

Iroha runs as a daemon _(irohad)_, representing a single peer in the Iroha network. For each peer, there is the following package structure, corresponding to components in the system:

* *Torii* (⛩, gate) is a package that contains classes, which are in charge of interaction with users (clients)
* *Network* encompasses interaction with the network of peers
* *Validation* classes check business rules and validity (correct format) of transactions or queries
* *Synchronizer* helps to synchronize new peers in the system or temporarily disconnected peers
* *Simulator* generates a temporary snapshot of storage to validate transactions
* *Ametsuchi* is the ledger block storage
* *Model* classes are system entities, and converters for them

For other components and more explanations, please take a look at the *technical and design docs.*

## Quickstart

Please, follow [build process](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#build).
After building Iroha daemon, try to use [CLI](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#command-line-interface) or launch Iroha [peer network](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/12517377/Create+swarm+network+of+Iroha+nodes).
